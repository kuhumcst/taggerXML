Fixed bug in XMLtext.cpp that caused words containing character references not

with some inputs.

version 3.12 / 2019.11.19
Changed (CONST)VOIDP to (const) char* in some cases.
Removed a test from an alternation that duplicated another test in the same
alternation, but that also imposed an extra condition, having no effect.

Added decoding of numeric character references and html character entity 
references.

version 3.10 / 2017.06.07

Start of changelog.
There have been several versions of taggerXML before this changelog was
started.

taggerXML is based on Eric Brill's part of speech tagger. The original C-code
is changed to C++ code and made platform-agnostic. (The original code was for
UNIX platforms only.)
In this version a number of improvements have been made. Janez Brank suggested
a number of improvements to get rid of memory leaks. These have all been
implemented.
The program could crash if the last line of text input (one sentence-per-line)
didn't end with whitespace. This is solved.
The program was not stable if #define STREAM 1 (in defines.h). This is solved.
A lot of commented code and useless comments were removed. There is still a
lot left.
