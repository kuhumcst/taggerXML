references.

Start of changelog.
There have been several versions of taggerXML before this changelog was
started.

taggerXML is based on Eric Brill's part of speech tagger. The original C-code
is changed to C++ code and made platform-agnostic. (The original code was for
UNIX platforms only.)
In this version a number of improvements have been made. Janez Brank suggested
a number of improvements to get rid of memory leaks. These have all been
implemented.
The program could crash if the last line of text input (one sentence-per-line)
didn't end with whitespace. This is solved.
The program was not stable if #define STREAM 1 (in defines.h). This is solved.
A lot of commented code and useless comments were removed. There is still a
lot left.
